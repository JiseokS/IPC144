1. I used switch case.

 Example)
        printf("Set the year and month for the well-being log (YYYY MM): ");
		scanf("%d %d", &year, &month);
 
        switch (month) {
		case 1:
			printf("JAN");
			break;
		case 2:
			printf("FEB");
			break;
		}


2. Interation constructs are while, do while, for
   reason) There is no fixed number of iterations, so i use do while loop. In some cases, using "while" does not execute the output, so i used "do while" to execute the command first and finally examined the conditions.


3. Firstly, run debugging. If it doesn't execute and a warning pops up, it's syntactic errors. Look at the solution in the error list below and find out what is wrong(kind of C language grammar mistake)
   The program execute well, but if the result is not what i expect, it is a semantic error. For example, i failed to produce the results of Morning total rating(that is the last part), and i checked all logic about Morning total rating again.
