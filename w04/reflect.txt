1. I compared the Value with the entrance valuse using if and for loop

2. If it starts with a 1(nonzero), the array does not fit because array starts with zero.
   When saving Priority, Financed, and Cost values in an their arrays, the for loop must be start with zero to save from the beginning of the arrays.
